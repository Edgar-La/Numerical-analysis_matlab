# Numerical-analysis_matlab
Repository that includes several algorithms to solve problems based in Numerical Methods, i.e. branch of mathematics to simulate approximations.
The programs will be written in MATLAB and GNU Octave.

Actually, this repo include only equations systems.
Updates will come soon.
